# TanStack Query React Example Project

This repository contains a simple React application demonstrating how to use **TanStack Query** for data fetching. The app fetches a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API and allows users to create new posts. It showcases:

- **Data fetching** using `useQuery` for retrieving posts.
- **Creating posts** with `useMutation` and automatic query invalidation.
- **Error and loading state management** for a better user experience.
- **Integration of TanStack Query DevTools** for inspecting queries and mutations.

Clone the repository to explore the code and see how TanStack Query simplifies data management in React applications.
